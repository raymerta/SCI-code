Example code to find peak double precision floating point performance.
The code is taken from R. Rahman "Intel Xeon Phi Coprocessor Architecture and Tools, The Guide for Application Developers" Apress  2013.

To run the code on the Rocket cluster at the University of Tartu (http://www.hpc.ut.ee/rocket_cluster), put the code on the cluster. Then log into booster1 by using
ssh booster1
and then entering your password.

load the Intel parallel compiler suite, then use the included scripts to compile it. 

Check that nobody else is using the node booster2 by typing 
who
after which you can run the code directly using the example submission scripts as for settings to try.
You may also try the example slurm submission scripts directly. as indicated at:
