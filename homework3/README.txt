Some example programs to demonstrate MPI and OpenMP are given here.
You will need to compile the c programs using either gnu or intel
compiler suites, to set paths for these load the appropriate modules.

Please use a makefile or bash script to compile the programs, so that
we can determine how you did this as it may impact the results you 
get.

To plot your results, one program that may be helpful is gnuplot:

There is an installation script associated with GNU plot that demonstrates
how to install and run it on the command line.
