The example program here shows how to compile and run helloworld
on Rocket. Once you have the files and have loaded the OpenMPI
module or setup OpenMPI with paths correctly set, type ``make''
on the command line, then submit the batch script using 
sbatch Rocketsubscript

More information on submitting parallel jobs on Rocket is at:
http://www.hpc.ut.ee/user_guides/SLURM#2.4.1

Consider also trying out the Intel MPI library.
